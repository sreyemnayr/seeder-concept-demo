ONBOARDING ASHLEY

Ashley: Sign me up for Seeder!

Seeder: Great. Tell me about the last time you were of service in your community. What motivated you and how did it feel?

Ashley: I spent a day at a local animal shelter cleaning crates and walking dogs. I love animals and wanted to help, but to be honest being in the shelter was just too heartbreaking for me. I need to find another way help. I will say I enjoyed meeting the other volunteers though. It felt like I was part of a new community.

Seeder: That's understandable. Have you considered fostering in your home? Fosters need a fenced yard and ideally are gone no more than 5 hours a day. If that’s not you, you could also just help hold a leash at an adoption event.

Ashley: I do have a fenced yard and I work from home. I could do either of those.

Seeder: Great. Do you have any preferences or restrictions on the kind of dogs you can foster?

Ashley: I prefer smaller dogs. I am also open to older dogs. But they do have to be cat friendly - I have some strays I take care of who I don’t want to run off.

ONBOARDING SAM

Sam: Sign me up for Seeder

Seeder: Great. Let’s get some logistics out of the way. When are you most available and how often do you want to be called into service?

Sam: I am retired and flexible. I’d like to be called into service at least weekly.

Seeder: Wonderful to hear. Why do you want to serve? Are there values, beliefs, or inspirations that guide your choices in life?

Sam: I was a career lawyer who made lots of money, but burned a lot of relationships. I am lonely now and my dog is my only real friend. I see the error of my ways. I want to do meaningful work and be in community.

Seeder: We are all on a journey. If you are feeling lonely, are there types of people you feel especially drawn to connect with?

Sam: I’d love to be around younger people. I am old with a lot of life experience. Maybe I could help them not make the mistakes I did and they could cheer me up a bit.

Seeder: Thanks for sharing all of that. You now have a Seeder profile — living, flexible, and centered on who you are. We’ll be in touch when we think you are the right person to answer a call for service.

ORG ASK:

Frankie: We need an urgent 2 week temp foster for a mid size mutt.

Seeder: Got it. Does the dog have any special needs or circumstances we should know about?

Frankie: Dog and Cat friendly, working on not jumping up on people.
Seeder: Looking for your volunteer now.

VOLUNTEER MATCH (part 1):

Seeder: Hi Ashley, we have an urgent need for a temp foster. The dog is cat friendly, but does tend to jump up on people. Ready to try fostering?

Ashley: I’d love to help, but I have a guest staying with me next week. Can I check and see if they would be ok with this?

Seeder: Sure. This is urgent so we will keep looking. When should we check back with you.

Ashley: give me half an hour.

VOLUNTEER MATCH (part 2):

Seeder: Sam, you said you have lots of flexibility with your schedule. We have an urgent temp foster needed. It's a midsize mutt who is dog friendly, but does tend to jump on people.

Sam: I’d love to, but I just threw out my back. I don’t think I can handle a dog that jumps on me a lot right now.

Seeder: Understood, we'll make a note that your availability is limited for the next month or two. Does that sound good?

Sam: Sounds good, hope you find someone!

VOLUNTEER MATCH (part 3):

Seeder: Ashley, did you hear back from your friend?

Ashley: Yes, she’s down for a foster dog during her stay.

Seeder: Great. Connecting you to the org. They will take you through their standard vetting process for first time fosters

VOLUNTEER REFLECTION

Seeder: Ashley - how was your first fostering experience?

Ashley: I loved it. He was a challenging little guy, but I really enjoyed it all the same. I’d definitely foster more in the future.

Seeder: Glad to hear it!

ORG REFLECTION

Seeder: Org - how did Ashely do with her first temp foster?

Frankie: Ashley was great. She bought dog toys and for his stay even though it was only a short one. We’d love to see her as a regular fostering candidate.

Seeder: That's great! I've updated her biography to indicate that it was a good match!
