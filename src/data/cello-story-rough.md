ONBOARDING

Alex: Sign me up Seeder! My cause is animal welfare.

Seeder: Thank you for joining Seeder for animal welfare.
We'd love to ask you a few questions to get to know you better — your gifts, your values, your hopes — so we can connect you to service opportunities that truly fit. You can type or speak your responses. Ready to begin?

Alex: Sure.

Seeder: What are you good at — in work, in life, or just for fun?
Don’t hold back — all gifts matter here.

Alex: I work as an accountant, but my passion is music. I used to play in bands. My instrument is the cello.

Seeder: Wonderful, both your profession and your passion bring skill sets that could help the animal welfare community. Are you also interested in direct volunteering opportunities at local shelters and rescues?

Alex: I don’t have time due to my work schedule. Weekends are for family, but I could fit in some pro-bono accounting in the evenings for an org.

ORG MAKES AN ASK

Sara: We need musical entertainment for our upcoming fundraiser. Can you help find someone.
Seeder: Sure. First a few clarifying questions. Are you looking for a band? Do they need to be well-known to draw a crowd?
Sara: No, it's really more like background music for the seated dinner.
Seeder: Got it. When and at what time is the event?
Sara: It's a thursday evening on september 19th
Seeder: Great. Looking for your perfect volunteer now.

VOLUNTEER SEARCH

Seeder: Alex, there is an opportunity that matches your interests and availability. Of all the people in your Seeder community, you seem best suited to answer the call. Would you be available to play your cello for a seated dinner fundraiser on September 19th?

Alex: Wow really. I’d love to get my cello out for this.

Seeder: Great. I’ll connect you to the org and the two of you can take it from there.

MATCH CONFIRMATION:
Seeder: We’ve found a cellist who used to play music professionally. Their name is Alex and they're expecting a call from you at 504-504-5040.

Alex: Great!

VOLUNTEER REFLECTION

Seeder: How was your experience performing at the fundraiser Alex?
Alex: It was really delightful. I got to get out my cello and help the animal welfare cause. It was a win-win for me. I also got to speak to the founder who needs help with bookkeeping so I might have a new pro-bono client.

Seeder internal: That's great! It's also great to learn about your bookkeeping abilities!

ORG REFLECTION

Seeder: How did Alex do at the fundraiser?

Sara: He was very nice, but his cello playing was just ok and he arrived late. So not sure we would work with him again as a musician, but he did offer his accounting services so we are going to take him up on that this month and see if it goes better.

Seeder: Understood. I've updated his biography to indicate a little less confidence in his musicianship. We will check back at the end of the month to see how you experience with him offering his accounting skills goes.
