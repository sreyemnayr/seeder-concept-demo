- What are you good at — in work, in life, or just for fun? Don’t hold back — all gifts matter here.
- Wonderful, both your profession and your passion bring skill sets that could help the animal welfare community. Are you also interested in direct volunteering opportunities at local shelters and rescues?
- Tell me about the last time you were of service in your community. What motivated you and how did it feel?
